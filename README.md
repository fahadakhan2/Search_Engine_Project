# Wiki Search
WikiSearch is a text-based search engine built in Python that allows a user to input a query and a collection of documents to search through. The search engine then processes the query and returns a ranked list of search results based on the relevance of the documents to the query. The document collection that the search engine is given is in a specific json format that is a dictionary of different documents. Each document has fields such as document id, title of document, description, text etc.
This project had put a great emphasis on testing in development. I used testing practices such as unit tests and test driven development to insure the accuracy and reliability of the search engine.I wanted to build a project that would allow me to apply my knowledge in data structures and algorithms, and natural language processing techniques. I have always been interested in search engines and the algorithms behind them that make them efficient which led me to do this project.
